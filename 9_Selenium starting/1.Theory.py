#Manual testing :
#-------------------
#Execution is slower for test cases
#Conducted by humans entirely. Hence, more chances of errors.
#It doesn’t need the programming knowledge as the steps to be executed are pre-defined
#Can handle some small number of test cases compared to automation testing
#Time for execution is more - slower execution time
#test cases can be missed
#can happen mistakes in replication steps
#regression test- can be skipped & try main functions only
#**************************************************************************************************

#Automation testing :
#------------------------
#testing done by system instead of human
#Faster execution of test cases.
#Less human intervention. Hence, lesser chance of errors.
#Knowledge in Programming language is mandatory for writing scripts
#Large number of test cases can be handled.
#**************************************************************************************************

#Tool :
#Selenium - open source automation tool as for web browsers
#provide multiple language supports - Py, Java, c#

#Selenium is an automation testing tool used for testing web applications alone.
#It is free and open source.

#**************************************************************************************************
#Advantages of Selenium are as below :
#--------------------------------------
##Open source.: It become more convenient for individuals and firms to use it.
##Cross Browser Compatibility : It can be used with multiple browsers and Operating System.
#cross browser testing - checking compatibility of browsers - chrome/Edge/Bing
#cross platform compatibility : MAC/Linux/Win

##Support for Scripting Languages : Integration with multiple languages like Java, python, Ruby, C# etc.
#Parallel testing : like multiple users accessing the site at same time

##Integration with Other Tools: Selenium can be integrated with other tools for enhanced functionality:
###TestNG or JUnit for test management.
###Maven or Gradle for build automation.
###Jenkins for continuous integration. - Automation tool
#**************************************************************************************************

#Disadvantages of Selenium:
#----------------------------
##Can test only web applications.
##Programming language knowledge is mandatory.
##No built in feature for CI/test management/report generation.

#Testing framework is needed

#3 Components of Selenium :
#---------------------------

#1.Selenium IDE-
#
#there was a record button - we do manual thing directly
#there is stop button - it stops the recording & saves
#playbutton - creates java command using recorded video
#
#there is chance of deviating from given test way
#stopped 2-3 years back


#2.Selenium RC - remote control is there
#
#complicated way of doing by human intervention
#commands became complex
#web components accessibility is not possible
#


#3.Selenium Webdriver : its a kind of plug-in
#
#interaction with application is possible
#
#

#4.Selenium Grid :
#
#as for multiple parallel testing scenario
#
